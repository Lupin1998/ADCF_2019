# ADCF_2019
code for Adaptive Target Tracking Algorithm with Dynamic Weighted Hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network Feature.

## 1. Intro
 - This project includes source code for first experience in our paper based on PyTorch and usage of CNN features.
 - For models, inlcuding mainstream models from torchvision [(PyTorch)](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html) in 
 CNNFeat. Models from tensorflow or caffe should perform better on visual tracking.
